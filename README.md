This repository contains code for a new method for clustering multivariate short time series with potentially many missing values (published [here](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/11/giz134/5626377)), a setting commonly encountered in the analysis of longitudinal clinical data, but generally still poorly addressed in the literature. The method is based on a variational autoencoder with a Gaussian mixture prior (with a latent loss as described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05148)), extended with LSTMs for modeling multivariate time series, as well as implicit imputation and loss re-weighting for directly dealing with (potentially many) missing values.
